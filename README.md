# AvorlionFrontEnd created with Create-React-App

This JS/React application is the front end to my DnD FullStack application I am using to monitor and record my DnD game as well as providing my players with an information respository to the World and to previous game sessions. 

I am using React Router to link sites, Spring boot Java back end and Postgresql DB.

## Current Components

-Character Cards
-God Cards
-Map Cards
-Add forms

### Future ideas
-Interactive Maps
-Auth stuff
-Filters to all data
-History Component

### Eventually this will be an Android App
